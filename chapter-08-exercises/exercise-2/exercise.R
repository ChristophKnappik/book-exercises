# Exercise 2: using `*apply()` functions

# Create a *list* of 10 random numbers. Use the `runif()` function to make a 
# vector of random numbers, then use `as.list()` to convert that to a list
rand_list <- as.list(runif(10))


# Use `lapply()` to apply the `round()` function to each number, rounding it to 
# the nearest 0.1 (one decimal place)
rand_list <- lapply(rand_list,round,1)


# Create a variable 'sentence' that contains a sentence of text (something 
# longish). Make the sentence lowercase; you can use a function to help.
sentence <- tolower("Das ist ein l�ngerer Testsatz, der vielleicht noch l�nger sein k�nnte.")


# Use the `strsplit()` function to split the sentence into a vector of letters.
# Hint: split on `""` to split every character
# Note: this will return a _list_ with 1 element (which is the vector of letters)
split_list <- strsplit(sentence,"")


# Extract the vector of letters from the resulting list
split_vector <- unlist(split_list)


# Use the `unique()` function to get a vector of unique letters
unique_letters <- unique(split_vector)


# Define a function `count_occurrences` that takes in two parameters: a letter 
# and a vector of letters. The function should return how many times that letter
# occurs in the provided vector.
# Hint: use a filter operation!
count_occurrences <- function(letter, vector_letters){
  length(vector_letters[vector_letters == letter])
}
count_occurrences("a",c("a","b","a"))

# Call your `count_occurrences()` function to see how many times the letter 'e'
# is in your sentence.
count_occurrences("e",split_vector)


# Use `sapply()` to apply your `count_occurrences()` function to each unique 
# letter in the vector to determine their frequencies.
# Convert the result into a list (using `as.list()`).
unique_occurrences <- as.list(sapply(split_vector,count_occurrences,vector_letters=split_vector))


# Print the resulting list of frequencies
print(unique_occurrences)
